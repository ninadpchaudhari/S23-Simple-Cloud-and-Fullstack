# To quickly launch an instance
Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.

1. In the navigation bar at the top of the screen, the current AWS Region is displayed (for example, US East (Ohio)). Select a Region in which to launch the instance. This choice is important because some Amazon EC2 resources can be shared between Regions, while others can't. For more information, see Resource locations.

2. From the Amazon EC2 console dashboard, choose Launch instance.

3.  (Optional) Under Name and tags, for Name, enter a descriptive name for your instance.

4. Under Application and OS Images (Amazon Machine Image), choose Quick Start, and then choose the operating system (OS) for your instance.

5. Under Key pair (login), for Key pair name, choose an existing key pair or create a new one.

6. In the Summary panel, choose Launch instance.
